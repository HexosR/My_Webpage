        Describing my work in this practicals:
        After finishing all practical sessions and creating my very first website
        I am very excited and I hope that I will lear more about web development in the future.
        Each worksheet teach me something new and it was very satisfying form me to do this tasks for my own.
        I have some difficulties with this worksheets because that was the first time I have been programming
        my very own website in the server. About this difficulties: I was struggling witch implementing CSS file to my
        HTML site and to create a decent looking pattern in my site.
        After implementing my JS file to my HTML file I had an difficulty to make it work properly.
        Some features that i have implemented does not worked as I had programmed it, but over all everything it working
        as should.
        I'm very pleased with over all look of my site and all features and design that i have done so far in Web Dev
        practicals.
        I'm sure that this practicals gave me very useful knowledge which for sure help me in the future in my work and
        in my life.
